I suddenly realized that we most likely have lots of artists in our group that have music on BandCamp.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in anticipation for the next BandCamp Friday, I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting a page with links to all of our artists with a BandCamp presence. The next BandCamp Fridays this year will be on:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Planning a Big Band Dance for the Old Timers</title><link>http://sixdegreesofohio.com/post/big-band-dance-for-old-timers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 18:51:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://sixdegreesofohio.com/post/big-band-dance-for-old-timers/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="file-under-putting-it-out-to-the-universe">File under &amp;ldquo;Putting it out to the universe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The next two posts should probably be filed under &amp;ldquo;Putting it out to the universe&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;If I had unlimited funds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am putting it out there in the hope that if we get enough people to see it, we can build a team to make this happen. It started as a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/sergio101/posts/10171422048675595">Facebook Posts&lt;/a> this week, and I got enough responses from people who said they&amp;rsquo;d be willing to help, it should be documented.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>June Theme: Live Tracks</title><link>http://sixdegreesofohio.com/post/theme-live-tracks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://sixdegreesofohio.com/post/theme-live-tracks/</guid><description>&lt;p>In June, I&amp;rsquo;d like to create a theme-based show featuring live tracks from our featured artists. The idea is, and entire show of live music captured in your favorite clubs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are not yet a featured artist (meaning you&amp;rsquo;ve been played on the show before), now is the perfect time to submit tracks and get into the rotation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For submission guidelines, please check:&lt;/p>

This is a pretty deep dive, and it goes on for more than an hour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in this kinda thing, go nuts! But I&amp;rsquo;ll be breaking it down further with links to spots that might be interesting for everyone. For now, I am posting the entire thing.&lt;/p>
