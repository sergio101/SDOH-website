  <div class="prose clear-both">
    <p>There is no us, there is just me, your faithful DJ, your old pal, Sergio.</p>
<p>I grew up listening to radio station from all over the world on a home made shortwave rig. I loved listening to people spinning playlists from the ehter, and always felt like I was discovering things that has been since unknown.</p>
<p>I dreamed about being that guy, sharing is record collection over the airwaves.</p>
<p>In a time where everything is available via the internet, I am most content to know that I am sharing record finds with firends old and new.</p>
<p>You will find music from Ohio, and in most cases, they will be friends of mine who I have shared the stage with over the years.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
